# Dart_Phone_Mnemonic

This is an improved web version of the Java code from [Last year's Phone-Mnemonic](https://github.com/DocJava/Phone-Mnemonic "Le old Code")

I wrote this because I had a little free time and saw that I had a project on here that could be greatly improved upon


Feel free to poke at it and try to break it!!

Special thanks to [WardellBagby](https://github.com/wardellbagby "A pretty awesome dude") for being my rubber duck and sounding board!
